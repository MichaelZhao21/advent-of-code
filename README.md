# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

This is a yearly Advent calendar for programming problems! It's a series of 50 super fun (and challenging) questions that get revealed each day. Each of the 25 day's problems consist of 2 parts, totaling in 50 problems. I really like that these problems don't require complex data structures or algorithms to solve, so anyone with a bit of programming knowledge can take them on.

There's also a global leaderboard, but I definitely don't have the consistent time commitment to compete. I would highly recommend anyone to give it a go! There's archives of all the past years' problems up on the site, and the problems start easier then get harder on subsequent days. The site also has pretty ASCII art that gets revealed as you complete problems hehe.
